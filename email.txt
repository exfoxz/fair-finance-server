Harlem Shake? I spent most of last weekend watching flash mobs of them. A growth mindset in my words is mostly something you did, but you know you could do better, expecally if you get comments on how good you did but also get some feedbacks on how you can improve it. I believe that Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan uses a growth mindset in their own lives because they are pretty much known worldwide for doing things. Tiger Woods is probley the main golfer someone can think of on the top of there heads and he is know for his skills into become a pro golfer. Michael Jordan is a basketball ledged and he can't just become a ledged out of the no where, he had to work hard over his life time to be where he's at now. Another he has a growth mindset is that he uses his power of fame and reconition to create his own brand of Jordan sneakers and apparel. Another person I think that used a growth mindset to achieve their success is Jay Z because he ahs been working towards his goal around his teen years, even through diffacult time settings in his life. Now that he is famous and REALLY rich, he still expands his growth minset and invest in things like is own clothing line, colones, charitey and he even has his own reccord label (Roc Nation). I think Jay Z growth mindset will keep expanding because more things can get him an idea to keep growing. A time I usesd a mindset is when I was first learning how to draw anime and other things. I didn't really know how to but two people who was in my class draw like they were making an anime. So over the years, I kept practicing how to draw better, I started to look at comics/ mangas and shows like Naruto and draw something from it. Everytime I tried it came out badly or half correct. So I kept practicing and now I can kind of draw what I see. From, bill
